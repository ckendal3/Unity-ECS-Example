# Unity-ECS-Example
This repo is a testing ground for Unity's ECS system as it releases using barebones. 
Hopefully it helps others taking the first step into the realm of "Performance by Default"...

I will try and keep this updated as future versions release. 

Please feel free to let me know better ways of doing things or any bugs that you come across.
